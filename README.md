# 05-Day-Planner

Wow this one kicked my butt. Really the most frustrating project so far. It wasn't for a lack of time and thought. It's a lack of experience.

## Where I'm Lacking
I'm not yet thinking like a computer. I thought this would be one of the hardest things for me when I signed up for the course. That's proving to be true. I have the syntax down. If you tell me to write something, I can write the code and pull different functions out. I'm 100% learning and getting better. But this project reminded me just how far I have to go

## The Project
### Creating the conte dynamically
This was a piece of cake. I finished it in a couple hours. No big deal. I feel like I have a really strong grasp of bootstrap, CSS and UI. This didn't cause me many problems.

### Saving to Local Storage
This was extremely challenging for me. I spent a couple hours trying to setup an object with different keys for my different times of day. I failed miserably. No matter what I looked up or the different ways I tried to approach this, I couldn't get this going. So I ended up creating seperate variables for everyting, seperate on-click listeners for each button, seperate everything! I didn't use 'this', which I'm disappointed in myself for not figuring out. But after hours trying to accomplish one small task, I knew I needed to take a different approach if I was going to finish this. So I switched boats midstream.

### Changing the background colors
This wasn't that hard, but I know my code is super inefficient. This took me maybe an hour or so to figure out. I definitely had some scoping issues where I was trying to call variables too high in my document, associating them with different ids, and it not working. Could scoping be a reason other things I tried didn't work? Certainly a possibility.
